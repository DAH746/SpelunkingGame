## Gem Rusher (2D Platformer and Action Video Game)
\** Transferred from the university enterprise github account to my personal github, therefore insights are not accurate.*

Built using C#, Unity, GitHub, and free 3rd party assets on Unity store (see Third-party Free Assets section below for more information).

Concept:
Gem Rusher at its core is a 2D platformer and action game.

The goal is to stay alive, obtain gems, and complete each level in a fast fashion. Where a
faster completion time, and the difficulty level the game is played on, is directly proportional
to an additional bonus score at the end of each level.

The levels are filled with enemies that can be killed or avoided, and traps that must be
avoided. This is in order to reach the end of each level alive. Depending on the difficulty selected by
the player, the leniency is decided. For example, on hard, the player cannot take any
damage from any source. Whereas on easy or normal, the player can receive damage from
any source and still be able to continue with a then smaller health pool.
